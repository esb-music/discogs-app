# discogs-app

discogs-app is a web app for exploring discographies. The basic idea of the app is that
it's data-centric, i.e. that one can extend the discographies without having to change the 
javascript code of the app. The resulting website is 
[esb-music.gihub.io](https://esb-music.github.io).

The companion project is [discogs-db](https://github.com/esb-music/discogs-db) which includes
the tools for generating and validating the JSON files used by discogs-app to provide the
data for esb-music.github.io.
