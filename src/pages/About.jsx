      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>This is discogs-app Rev. {constants.appRev} using the description files
        revision {revision.rev} from {dateFormat(revision.date)}.<br/>
        The app was developed by Pavlo Rozbytskyi and Burkhardt Renz, the current maintainer.</p>
      <h4>Purpose and Concept</h4>
      <p>The app lets you explore discographies of musicians or bands.<br/>
        The basic idea: The app uses the descriptions of musicians, albums and tracks provided in the data folder
        of the website to display the information.</p>
      <p>To extend the app with further musicians, it's just necessary to upload the descriptions to the data
        folder. The actual code of the app remains untouched.</p>
      <h4>A bit of history</h4>
      <p>Pavlo made a first variant of the app. His approach was a graphical representation of the relationships
        between musicians, albums, tracks and instruments. He developed this variant 2020 as a part of his software
        project at the Technische Hochschule THM in Gie√üen, Germany. The project is hosted at <a
          href="https://github.com/prozb/miles-davis-project" target={"_blank"}>Github</a>.</p>
      <p>In 2022 Burkhardt revisited the app and changed the user interface to a text-based appearance. The reason
        was that the app should work well on mobile devices too.</p>
